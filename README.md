A set of useful macros for the SWADE system. Growing list, currently:

- Shooting Roll: Automatically pulls ranged weapons from token, allows you to input modifiers like range, recoil, etc, spits out rolls to Chat and auto reduces ammo.
- Damage Roll: Auto calculated damage based on target toughness. To use it, select your token, then TARGET another token. It'll pull the armor and toughness values from the targetted token and print any notes the target armor has.
- Fighting Roll: Auto calcuates your Fighting die vs Target's parry including any shields they might have.
- Nnayl AIO macro: A full combat sequence between a actor and this target. Select attack type, weapons and set your mod for a automated rolls et calculated results, from attack to damage.

This module will use Dice So Nice if that's installed.
