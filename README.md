A set of useful macros for the SWADE system. Growing list, currently:

- Shooting Roll: Automatically pulls ranged weapons from token, allows you to input modifiers like range, recoil, etc, spits out rolls to Chat and auto reduces ammo.
- Damage Roll: Auto calculated damage based on target toughness. To use it, select your token, then TARGET another token. It'll pull the armor and toughness values from the targetted token and print any notes the target armor has.
