A set of useful macros for the SWADE system. Growing list, currently:

- Shooting Roll: Automatically pulls ranged weapons from token, allows you to input modifiers like range, recoil, etc, spits out rolls to Chat and auto reduces ammo.
- Damage Roll: Auto calculated damage based on target toughness. To use it, select your token, then TARGET another token. It'll pull the armor and toughness values from the targetted token and print any notes the target armor has.
- Fighting Roll: Auto calcuates your Fighting die vs Target's parry including any shields they might have.
- Nnayl AIO macro: A full combat sequence between a actor and this target. Select attack type, weapons and set your mod for a automated rolls and calculated results, from attack to damage. You can reroll with Bennies and set some settings for damage rolls
- Card Draw Macro: Draws a # of cards to the table as Tiles for Chases and such

This module will use Dice So Nice if that's installed.
